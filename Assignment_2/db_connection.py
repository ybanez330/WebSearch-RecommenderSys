    # 2 Insert the document in the database. For num_chars, discard the spaces and punctuation marks.
    # --> add your Python code here

    # 3 Update the potential new terms.
    # 3.1 Find all terms that belong to the document. Use space " " as the delimiter character for terms and Remember to lowercase terms and remove punctuation marks.
    # 3.2 For each term identified, check if the term already exists in the database
    # 3.3 In case the term does not exist, insert it into the database

    # 4 Update the index
    # 4.1 Find all terms that belong to the document
    # 4.2 Create a data structure the stores how many times (count) each term appears in the document
    # 4.3 Insert the term and its corresponding count into the database
    # --> add your Python code here
